					<p class="text-center"> My name is Jonathan wydola and I am a senior CS student. I have attended Umass Dartmouth in my previous college adventures.
						I look to graduate this semester and to pursue a job that works with python and SQL. I have previously been employed by Putnam 
						Investments where I worked with python scripts to manipulate millions of rows of data. 
						I participated in one co-op, it is a great program, try it.</p>

							<h4><a href="assignments/HW1/index.html">Assignment1</a></h4>
								<p class="text-center">For the first assignment we were asked to complete the setup of our weblab server. as 
								the viewer can determine; the server is up and contains my public_html folder.
								(I do not have my original html file so i included a hello world index.html since that
								was our basic understanding of html for this assignment).
								</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4">
							<h4><a href="assignments/public_htmlHW2/index.html">Assignment2</a></h4>
								<p class="text-center">For assignment two we were asked to complete an index.html page. As the viewer can see, they are able to access
								my index.html page. Originally my page was just some text with a completley different format for the boxes and div
								tags on this page. I have also removed some pictures and some headers that were previously redundant and were just for practice.
								</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4">
							<h4><a href="assignments/HW3/HW3_source/index.html">Assignment3</a></h4>
								<p class="text-center">For assignment 3 we were asked to put our CSS skills to the test. This test was to format a html page using a css
								stylesheet. we were required to link the style sheet to the html and to do all of our styling through that reference.
								I struggled at some detailed points such as determining margin sizes. when I implemented the css, the results were not the same as
								the pdf.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4">
							<h4><a href="assignments/public_htmlHW4/index.html">Assignment4</a></h4>
								<p class="text-center">For this assignment we are asked to put out css styles to the test in using our own creativity. For this assignment
								I decided to use a div id for my top header. This section serves as a block for my logo image and navagation bar.
								this navagtion bar current just links to locaitons on my page. Im not sure if i want to implement more pages or just have 
								the index page updated. I also use a flex box to control the contents of the page when the page size changes. Following that are sections that include information about myself including my major etc.
								I made this page with the idea that one I got this general design down adding to it would be easy. I want to find a better color schema for my page but 
								the general formatting and how the letter flow and looked was my main concern in proving and providing css knowledge.
								</p>

							<h4><a href="https://jonathanwydola.github.io/myPage/">Assignment 5</a></h4>
